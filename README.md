##### java_northwind
A java ee jdbc web application using the northwind database on SQL Server

I have used the northwind database because there are already a lot of related tables (one to many and many to many relationships) so it was a good opportunity to test my skills in object binding.

I will be posting screenshots here when I will create the views with jsp.

Always using intelliJ  ultimate and maven :)
